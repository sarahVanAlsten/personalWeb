Sequence analysis is a technique used in longitudinal research to understand developmental trajectories. I will briefly cover the main goals of this technique and sample code of how to conduct analyses, but for an in depth discussion of the methodology and examples of sequence-type research questions, I'd recommend you browse through the TraMineR R package [user guide](http://mephisto.unige.ch/pub/TraMineR/doc/TraMineR-Users-Guide.pdf).
